# React Calculator

## About this app...
This is a super simple calculator app built using React and React Bootstrap.  It can solve simple arithmetic operations involving the 4 basic math operations.  Its not very fancy and I didn't spend much time styling, but the purpose of the app was to explore React Bootstrap components, which I had never used before, and to give me some more practice with React in general.

## Technologies
React, React Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS
